description: |
  Cadence MHDP Controller supports one or more of the protocols,
  such as HDMI and DisplayPort.
  Each protocol requires a different FW binaries.

  This document defines device tree properties for the Cadence MHDP Encoder
  (CDNS MHDP TX). It doesn't constitue a device tree binding
  specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific
  device tree bindings.

  When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
  this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
  responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.

properties:
  reg:
    maxItems: 1
    description: Memory mapped base address and length of the MHDP TX registers.

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 2

  interrupt-names:
    - const: plug_in
      description: Hotplug detect interrupter for cable plugin event.
    - const: plug_out
      description: Hotplug detect interrupter for cable plugout event.

  port:
    type: object
    description: |
      The connectivity of the MHDP TX with the rest of the system is
      expressed in using ports as specified in the device graph bindings defined
      in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt. The numbering of the ports
      is platform-specific.
